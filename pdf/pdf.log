Network administrators can install Backup4all on a single computer and enter a single network registration key. All workstations can run the application from there.  For example if you have 25 users in a network environment, you will pay for 25 licenses and you will receive a single registration key valid for all 25 users.  Recommended solution for:     \xef\x82\xb7 Home users (2+ computers in a network environment, i.e. using the laptop to backup onto desktop or vice-versa) \xef\x82\xb7 Professional Services \xef\x82\xb7 Service Industries \xef\x82\xb7 Telecommunications \xef\x82\xb7 Education \xef\x82\xb7 Government            Summary:    Backup4all\xe2\x80\x99s network licensing provides a solution for large computer environments with a special focus on the network environment. Backup4all is designed to be reliable, easy-to-use and affordable. It can be used as a reliable backup solution in networks with hundreds of computers connected.   Major features and Benefits: \xef\x82\xb7 Powerful \xe2\x80\x93 Through its technology, Backup4all speeds up the backup process in a network environment giving you the benefit of having a reliable backup performed in a reduced amount of time. Its \xe2\x80\x9cmulti-threaded\xe2\x80\x9d feature allows multiple backups and restores to be performed simultaneously, while maintaining your data integrity. \xef\x82\xb7 Trustworthy \xe2\x80\x93 Backup4all makes the backup process more reliable by recording the settings used for the each backup process in .ini files that are stored on the computer where it is installed and also creates catalog files to keep track of modified/removed files. After each backup, by default, Backup4all also verifies the resulted zip files to ensure that the process was successful. \xef\x82\xb7 Easy installation and administration \xe2\x80\x93 Installing Backup4all is very easy and the administration process resumes itself to verifying the log files stored by Backup4all to see the status of the backup (successful/failed). The installation/administration process is easy both for network administrators and users. For example, in case of a network with several computers connected to a server, even if the configuration is done individually and saved on each of the user\xe2\x80\x99s computer, Backup4all can be installed only on the server and the users can backup directly from their workstations/laptops to it without having it installed?? The scheduling feature also helps users secure their data on a daily, weekly or monthly basis and spares time by automating this task. Backup4all ensures that servers are backed up to any chosen media and that all data is fully recoverable. \xef\x82\xb7 Key Features: o Zip compression o Automatic scheduling o Spanning over multiple media o Large data volume support o Zip testing o Different backup types o Simultaneous backup/restore o Report and logging   Technologies This product uses and/or supports the following technologies.  \xef\x82\xb7 Platform o Desktop and Notebook o Intel-Based  \xef\x82\xb7 Operating Systems o Microsoft(R) Windows(R) Operating Systems  Case-studies: \xef\x82\xb7 One source \xe2\x80\x93 multiple destinations: o  Backup sources are on one computer and the backup destination on other computers;  o Applicable when important data is stored on a computer (server) and to ensure full security the data is backed up onto multiple computers from that network; Backup4all stores the configuration files on the backed up station (server) and on each of the destination stations it places (beside the zip files) also the backup catalogs so that even if it is uninstalled from the server (or the server encounters technical problems), the backup is secured and the backup/restore process can easily be continued by installing Backup4all on another computer.  o Destination can be also removable media, like CDs/DVDs, USB drives, ZIP drives, that are connected to the destination stations.  \xef\x82\xb7 One-to-one, one source, one destination; laptop->desktop or vice-versa for example  \xef\x82\xb7 Multiple sources, one destination; backup sources on many computers, backup destination on a single one (server->client situation;)  \xef\x82\xb7 Multiple sources, multiple destinations; backup sources on multiple computers, backup destination on several computers   	 http://www.novapdf.com http://www.novapdf.com http://www.novapdf.com http://www.novapdf.com http://www.novapdf.com http://www.novapdf.com http://www.novapdf.com http://www.novapdf.com	(empty)	FUWUHW2cxYqRV1xo35
